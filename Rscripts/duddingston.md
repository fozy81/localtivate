Demo Page: Orchards in Central Scotland
---------------------------------------------------

<div class="custom-class" markdown="1" style="width:620px" align="justify" text-indent:50px;>
<p>This page displays orchards mapped on <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=11/55.8501/-4.1024" target="_blank">OpenStreetMap</a> in central Scotland. The highlighted orchards areas are supplemented with additional data entered on a Google spreadsheet. This test is to demostrate that temporal, subjective or private information can be linked to features added to OpenStreetMap. Small groups or organisations can use accessible tools such as google docs & openstreetmap to start creating a spatial dataset which can be easily updated. This technique is a light touch way to manage spatial assets using existing tools. In this instance, keeping track of orchard management/status and sharing that info with others.</p></div>
